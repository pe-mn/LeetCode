class Solution:
    def removePalindromeSub(self, s: str) -> int:
        return 2 - (s == s[::-1]) - (s == "")

# Good to Know
# You need to know the difference between subarray and subsequence.
# Subarray need to be consecutiveã€‚
# Subsequence don't have to be consecutive.


# Intuition
# If it's empty sting, return 0;
# If it's palindrome, return 1;
# Otherwise, we need at least 2 operation.


# Explanation
# We can delete all characters 'a' in the 1st operation,
# and then all characters 'b' in the 2nd operation.
# So return 2 in this case


# Complexity
# Time O(N)
# Space O(N), also O(1) space checking palindrome is suuggested.

        
# Wrong Answer
# "ababb" Output 3 Expected 2
